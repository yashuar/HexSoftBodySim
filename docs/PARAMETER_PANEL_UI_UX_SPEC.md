# PhysicsEngine2D Parameter Panel: Future UI/UX Specification

## Vision
A parameter panel that is not just functional, but delightful—empowering users of all skill levels to intuitively explore, tune, and understand soft tissue simulation. The UI adapts to user needs, provides guidance, and makes experimentation safe, fast, and rewarding.

## 1. Layout & Structure
- **Side Drawer:**
  - Fixed to the right, full height, scrollable, never overlaps main content.
  - Collapsible on mobile, with swipe and button toggle.
- **Header:**
  - App logo/name.
  - Always-visible Pause/Resume and Reset buttons.
  - Presets dropdown (Recommended, Realistic, Extreme, Custom).
  - Status display (Running/Paused, FPS, warnings).
- **Search Bar:**
  - Prominent, always at the top.
  - Filters parameters live.
- **Parameter Groups:**
  - Collapsible, reorderable sections (Physics, Scene, Advanced, etc).
  - All controls always present in DOM, only hidden by CSS.
  - Drag-to-reorder for power users.
- **Parameter Controls:**
  - Correct control type (slider, toggle, select, vector2).
  - Label, unit, live value, and short explanation under each control.
  - Tooltips and “Learn more” links for advanced parameters.
  - Pinning: Users can pin favorite controls to the top.
- **Footer:**
  - Add Mask Region button.
  - Restore Defaults button.
  - Undo/Redo controls.

## 2. Usability & Accessibility
- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  - Basic/Advanced toggle to show only core or all parameters.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Space: Pause/Resume
  - R: Reset
  - /: Focus search
- **Screen Reader & ARIA:**
  - All controls and groups have ARIA labels and roles.
  - Announce simulation state changes and parameter updates.
- **Touch & Mobile:**
  - Large touch targets, swipe to open/close drawer.
  - Responsive layout for all devices.

---

## 3. Feedback & Guidance
- **Live Feedback:**
  - As parameters change, show a summary of the expected effect (e.g., “Tissue will be stiffer”).
  - Color feedback for safe, warning, and error states.
- **Contextual Help:**
  - Inline explanations for each parameter.
  - Warnings for extreme/unstable values, with suggestions.
  - “Learn more” links to docs or scientific references.
- **Celebratory Feedback:**
  - Subtle success animation/message when simulation is stable and realistic.

---

## 4. Simulation State Awareness
- **Parameter Locking:**
  - Disable or gray out parameters that can’t be changed while running.
- **State Snapshots:**
  - Save/restore full simulation states, not just parameters.
- **Presets:**
  - Load/save parameter sets for different scenarios.

---

## 5. Visual & Emotional Design
- **Modern, clean, minimal:**
  - Material-style icons, subtle dividers, consistent spacing.
  - Micro-animations for control changes, group expand/collapse, and state changes.
- **Theming:**
  - Light and dark mode support.
  - User-selectable color themes.

---

## 6. Example User Flows
- **Tuning:**
  - User opens drawer, searches or browses, tweaks sliders/toggles, sees instant effect and feedback.
- **Experimenting:**
  - User pauses, changes parameters, resets, resumes to see new behavior, undoes/redo changes as needed.
- **Teaching:**
  - User collapses advanced group, focuses on basics, uses tooltips and explanations for learning.
- **Debugging:**
  - User sees warnings/errors, uses “Restore Defaults” or presets to recover.

---

## 7. Implementation Principles
- All parameter wiring and event handling is automatic from the schema.
- Collapse/expand is robust, accessible, and animated.
- All controls are always in the DOM, only hidden by CSS.
- No legacy or duplicate markup.
- All features are discoverable, accessible, and responsive.

---

## 8. Future-Proofing
- Easy to add new parameter types, groups, or simulation features.
- Modular code and CSS for maintainability.
- Designed for extensibility and user-driven customization.
